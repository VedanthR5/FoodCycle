## Inspiration

### What inspired you to create this app?

The inspiration for FoodCycle emerged from the stark paradox of food waste and hunger that plague our society. From our elementary years to now being high school students, we have witnessed firsthand the wastage of fresh, edible food in places like the cafeteria. This micro-level experience highlighted the potential for the preservation and distribution of surplus food.

On a broader scale, the United States grapples with the alarming fact that roughly one-third of all food goes to waste while millions face food insecurity. Even starker, 1.2 tons of food are wasted by supermarkets and restaurants every week. This paradox fueled our determination to develop a solution that addresses both problems simultaneously. We aimed to redirect food away from landfills and toward those who could benefit from it.

Additionally, we worked to empower local food markets and businesses to share their surplus food with the community. We envisioned an app that provided them with a secure, efficient, and rewarding platform to do so. FoodCycle catalyzes positive change, generating benefits that extend to the environment, the supply chain, and the welfare of our fellow citizens.
